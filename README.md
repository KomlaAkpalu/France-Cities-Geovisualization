# France-Cities-Geovisualization

Welcome to the `France-Cities-Geovisualization` repository! This project features an interactive map displaying the major cities across France, implemented with R and the Leaflet library for geospatial data visualization.

## Project Description

The interactive map is a demonstration of data analysis and visualization techniques applied to geospatial information. It showcases major French cities with markers that, when clicked, display the city name.
